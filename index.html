			<h1>What does "homeless" mean?</h1>
			<p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development defines homelessness in four broad categories:
		    <ul>
			<li>People who are living in a place not meant for human habitation, in emergency shelter, in transitional housing, or are exiting an institution where they temporarily resided.</li>
				
			<li>People who are losing their primary nighttime residence, which may include a motel or hotel or a doubled-up situation, within 14 days and lack resources or support networks to remain in housing.</li>
			<li>Families with children or unaccompanied youth who are unstably housed and likely to continue in that state.</li>
			<li>People who are fleeing or attempting to flee domestic violence, have no other residence, and lack the resources or support networks to obtain other permanent housing.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
