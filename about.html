			<h1>Did Government Tried To tackle This Issue?</h1>
			<p>Each Night half a million people in United States are home less.
		    <ul>
			<li>Some sleep in shelters, others on streets, and one quarter of them are children</li>
				
			<li>About 15 percent are chronically homeless, means they didn't have permanent home in years. They switch between jail, hospitals, and shelters to find a place to sleep</li>
			<li></li>
			<li>the averagemonthly cost of serving a family in an emergency shelter is $4,819</li>
			<li>voucher for housing, on the other hand, is just $1,162.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
		
		               
			
			<h2>Why homeless people are opting out of shelter and staying on streets?</h2>
			<p>They suffered through violence, theft, or other trauma in these ostensibly safer spaces.
				<ul>
					<li>826 “violent incidents” in New York City homeless shelters</li>
					<li>sexual assault and domestic violence</li>
					<li>Shelters don’t allow residents to develop a sense of permanency</li>
					<li>Numerious studies showed permanency  helps people get a job or stay sober</li>
					<li>Affordable housing is the best solution to end this problem</li>
					<li>Once they have safe home, they can look for other services</li>
					<li>Utah reduced its chronically-homeless population 72 percent between 2005 and 2014 through housing-first </li>
		       </ul>
