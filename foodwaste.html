			<li>On the other hand, millions of families struggling to have one decent meal.</li>
			<li>Food discarded by retailers and consumers in developed countries would be enough to feed Worlds 870 million hungry people.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
		
		               
			
			<h2>How can we connect these two issues?</h2>
			<p>Food getting wasted need to circulated among the needing and deserving people, instead of
				ending in trash.
				<ul>
					<li>Food waste is an environmental problem too.</li>
					<li>Food wastes ends up in landfills, where it decomposes and releases methane gas.</li>
					<li>Retailers and restaurants need to donate food to shelter homes or food pantries.</li>
					<li>Build a system, so food can get distributed to the needy  individuals.</li>
					<li>Bring awareness among people and businesses.</li>
					<li>Build a strong network of picking food from the businesses, and redistribute it to the hungry and poor.</li>
